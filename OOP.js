OOP: Object Oriented Programming:
unstructrue programing to make:

What is the object in javascript:
" Every thing In the world In Object"
for example: person, pen, tree, computer, car, 
 every object has two thing;
Every object has property and behavior

1] property : kay kay feature Hain
2] behavior : Kay kay kar sakta  Hain

Object Pen:
Property:
	type
	price
	color
	size
Behavior:
	Writing
	Drawing
	Tick Mark

in programing languge:
Class is the "template" or the "blue print" of a object
class{
	variable = property
			function = behavior
			"and we have the object of our class"
}


class PEN {
	
}

Properties of Object Oriented Programming
1] Polymorphism = "many-forms"
for exam 

class SHAPE {
	Draw();
		circle Object
		Draw(Circle);
			squre Object
			Draw(Square);
				Trinage Object
				Draw (Triangle);
	}


2] Inheritance:
jo hum inheritance karte he: mata pita se kuch inheritan karte he; jse sochane ka trika

 Class FATHER {
	{
	Boss() {}
	}

class son inherite father
			{
			boss(){}
			}
			Study(){}	
	}

3] Encapsulation: "Wrapping data and method in single unit":
chupa dena ya fir hide kar dena 
programing me hum encapsulation ka used q karte he: squrity ke liye
supos hune ek function banaya our hum chahute he ke ye dusra koi bhi access na kare

how to used encapsulation:
We do this by using access modifires like
public, private, protected
"Public are accessible to members of any class"
"Private are only accessible to other members of the same class"
"Protected are only accessible to other members of the same class, members of a subclass"

4] Abstraction:
"A bstraction means Hiding the unnecessary data and showing only the necessary data"
Lets say we have a "Student" Class so we may have property such as 
"Name, RollNo, Address, Phoine No, Class, Hobby"
But In Real We May Use Only Some so"
We should consider and define only those as the properties of the class and can neglecte/Hide other unnecessary properties. This is called Absgtraction
